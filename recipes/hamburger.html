    <h1>Hamburger Stroganoff</h1>
    <p><strong>I created this easy hamburger stroganoff recipe because I love the taste of a good stroganoff, 
        but I don't like the expense of beef tips, steak, or roast beef, nor do I like all the time it takes to make them.
         My version is creamy and tastes great.</strong></p>
