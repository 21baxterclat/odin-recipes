        <h3 class="list">Directions</h3>
        <ul class="Ingredients">
            <li>Preheat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Season both sides of the chicken thighs with paprika, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper.
                 Place chicken in pan and sear until browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
                  Flip chicken over and cook until browned, 6 to 8 minutes more. 
                  Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add onion, garlic, and ginger to the skillet. Cook until onion is softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes, stirring often. 
                Add in chicken stock, coconut milk, honey, Sriracha, and soy sauce. Bring mixture to a simmer, and reduce heat to low. 
                Cook sauce for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>      
            <li>In a small bowl or measuring cup, stir lime juice and cornstarch together. 
                Stir cornstarch mixture and lime zest into the pan, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce begins to thicken, 5 to 8 minutes. 
                Taste sauce, and adjust salt, pepper, honey and Sriracha amounts as needed. Add chicken thighs and any accumulated juices back to the skillet. 
                Continue cooking until chicken is heated and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li>To serve, sprinkle fresh cilantro over the chicken, and squeeze more fresh lime juice over the top if desired. 
                Sprinkle with toasted coconut, if desired.</li>
        </ul>
