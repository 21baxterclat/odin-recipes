    <h3><a href="./recipes/hamburger.html">Hamburger Stroganoff</a></h3>
    <p>I created this easy hamburger stroganoff recipe because I love the taste of a good stroganoff, 
        but I don't like the expense of beef tips, steak, 
        or roast beef, nor do I like all the time it takes to make them. 
        My version is creamy and tastes great.</p>

    <h3><a href="./recipes/chicken.html">Coconut Lime Chicken</a></h3>
    <p>This saucy coconut lime chicken is a nice way to switch up the usual dinner routine.
         It's super customizable; and is excellent when served over basmati or jasmine rice.</p>
